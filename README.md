# AJAX Moving Companion
Using jQuery and AJAX, created a move companion application that pulls data from three APIs: the New York Times, Wikipedia, and Google Streetview then dynamically modifies the DOM to display the information. Further customized the project by personalizing the design using Skeleton CSS

## How to Use this Application

Vist https://latashahussey.github.io/ajax-move-companion/ then enter the street address and city of the location where you would like to live. 

The app will return a Google Streetview of the location entered, articles featuring the location from the New York Times, and relevant links from Wikipedia.
